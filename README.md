Allows you to use i3-wm with GNOME 3 Session infrastructure.

**i3-gnome** works by doing its function as a window manager (i3-wm) but still using GNOME as a desktop environment (using the sessions, some services like power manager, audio, etc.) all in one session.

Also it helps you to maintain the **gtk+** feel for the general software used in GNOME (such as **nautilus** and so on).
