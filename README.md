Allows you to use i3-wm with GNOME 3 Session infrastructure.
i3-gnome works by doing its function as a window manager (i3-wm) but still using GNOME as a desktop environment (using the sessions, daemons, like power manager) all in one session.
Also it helps you to maintain the gtk feel and other GNOME configs in a easy way.
